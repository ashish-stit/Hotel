Additionally, we use more traditional sourcing methodologies such as networking, word of mouth and referrals.

                        <h4>A candidate rejected my initial personalised opportunity. What should I do?</h4>
If a candidate rejects your initial interview request, we’ll work with you to identify the potential factors (for example, salary or job scope) and give you the chance to revise your opportunity to meet the candidate’s expectations, if appropriate for both parties.
There are also new active talent joining the marketplace every week, and there may just be the perfect one for your company.

                        <h4>Can I contact the talent on Shortlist Chefs outside of the marketplace?</h4>
No. All candidates should be contacted via the Shortlist Chefs platform only to ensure that both you and the candidate get the best experience possible. Any breach of our terms of use may result in your company being removed from our marketplace.

We have a few options. Best talk to your account manager once you've signed up.

                        <h4>Can I see if other companies have approached the candidate I’m interested in?</h4>
No. You can't see who has approached the candidate you’re interested in.
